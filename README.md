## About This Project

This project is my first trial on `Next.js` and `Tailwind.css`. This is quite fast to create and deploy on `Vercel`

### Deployed App
```
quran-app-blush.vercel.app
```
### API that I'm using
```
https://quran.api-docs.io/v4/chapters/list-chapters
```

## Running on your machine
As simple as just `clone` and install dependencies, here I'm using yarn
```
yarn
```
you may prefered npm so just do
```
npm install
```

## Setup environment
make sure to look at `.env.local.example`. Simply just create `.env.local` and fill it as the example says.

### Thankyou!!
